Hello Dan

Files included in this assignment are 
A3, Parser, Scanner, SymbolTable, StRec, Token, TreeNode, OutputController

-if the terminal shows a null pointer exception, its not because the code is broken
but its actually a feature....... (hahaha)if certain grammar exceptions occur, such as 
cd19 token isn't in the structure it will return null. there are like 87ish exceptions that
return null. It is a design flaw but currently I don't have the time to revisit and fix this issue
as of now

-The printing is handled by the treenode printTree(), so its not
as tidy as I would want it to be, but currently Ive dedicated to much
time to it so I don't have the time to fix it.

-fixed the previous critiques in A1

-I don't really understand my parser. I made it but its weird. Some moments
it will run butter smooth and prints the program listing preoder traversal and 
error messages fine. And then for the same code with little to no modifications
it will print out errors saying that the identified token is invalid when checking
the actual token it is. Its 100% a design flaw but at this stage the error messages
are confusing me the more i debug.

-Within the Parser there is a debug boolean at the top if you wish to see 
the custom made error msgs since I didn't include a few of the error messages

into the the actual print out since the error checks are both used for prevention
and actual errors and aren't really in acordance to the output. It is a design flaw
so i included the printouts in a debug feature at the top. It has been turned on for 
now so please keep that in mind when marking please.

-no error recovery or correction has been attempted

-Outside of that I am submitting this about 2 weeks later than the due date
I poured my soul into this parser and its quite disheartening I couldn't get it to run
the exact way I wanted it to oh wells.


-format it should look like when the DanExample.txt file is run with debug turned to false
